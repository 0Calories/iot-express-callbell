# iot-express-callbell
An IoT based Call Bell system. Includes a locally hosted Express.js server to be used in conjunction with an Arduino MKR1000. 
The MKR1000 board has a button that will send a POST request to the server, which creates a Windows toast message (via the node-notifier npm module). 

Made this because my mom gets pissed when she calls my name and I can't hear her lmao
